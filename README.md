# RestAPI_Jukebox

This is my first RestAPI using Java, SpringBoot, Springfox and Swagger where you have a GET method for jukeboxes and its settings.

This project is supported with SpringBoot which is a framework that allowed me to create this API. We mainly have a entity class with its properties, and a controller for it which contains the GET method. Every entity will also have a repository to allow to have a factory of those entities. 

## Usage
To use the API, you must launch a server and send a GET request.

## API docs

To retrieve the API docs, you must launch the server send this

GET ```localhost:8080/v2/api-docs```
